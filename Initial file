"""
This is a program that takes in input, such as a phrase, song lyrics, or other text, and "translates" 
the text into Ubbi Dubbi, the made up language from the PBS show Zoom. 

This language features a syllable "ub" in front of any vowell sound. 

For example, in Ubbi Dubbi, the phrase, " Peace on earth" would be "P-ub-eace ub-on ub-earth."

This program operates by taking in a string of only letters and spaces and adds in the "ub" syllable 
as it iterates over each letter in each word.

The new translated text is return to the console.
